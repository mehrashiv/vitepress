In such deployments the DHCP server works in L2 mode, meaning the server is listening on all VLANs the customer has configured. The firewall is connected to the wireless controller or AP or switch with a trunk port. So, all DHCP broadcast packets make it to the firewall. Depending on which VLAN the packet is received the Fortigate or Palo Alto will respond with reply from that VLAN&#39;s subnet.</p><p>This is not how it works with Nile. Nile is a L3 architecture, so we don’t send any of the broadcast packets to the upstream router or firewall. We are an ip helper that sends an L3 DHCP packet to the DHCP server. The packet originated from the subnet that device should belong to. The source IP address is the default gateway of the client, and it is Nile. So, if there are 3 user subnets, Nile will be the default gateway for all three subnets and will have an IP on all three subnets. So, for example the subnets are 192.168.1.0/24, 192.168.2.0/24 and 192.168.3.0/24, then the customer can choose the default gateway to be 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1 and 192.168.3.1. These will become Nile&#39;s IP addresses.</p><p>When a user connects to a SSID, we check which subnet it belongs to and when a DHCP broadcast packet is sent we originate the ip-helper from that IP. <img src="'+o+'" alt="Relay Agent"> Since the DHCP server sits outside of the NSB, this traffic must be routed via the router or firewall to the DHCP server. The most common issue we see is, customers forget to create firewall rules to allow UDP 67, 68 originating from 192.168.1.1, 192.168.2.1 and 192.168.3.1 in this case. They have to allow every user subnet to exchange DHCP packets via the DHCP server.</p><h2 id="deep-dive" tabindex="-1">Deep Dive <a class="header-anchor" href="#deep-dive" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Deep Dive&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Lets look how this is configured <img src="'+r+'" alt="DHCP Settings"> In Nile Portal the customer must add details of their DHCP server. As see in the screenshot, they must do the following:</p><ol><li>Name - Required - Can be anything but must be unique across the tenant</li><li>Host 1 - The first DHCP server in the list</li><li>Host 2 - Optional - The second DHCP server in the list</li><li>Host 3 - Optional - The third DHCP server in the list</li><li>Geoscope - Required - Which sites this DHCP server serves</li><li>Subnet - Define afor.subnets and their respective default gateways that this sever is configured for</li></ol><h3 id="dhcp-redundancy" tabindex="-1">DHCP Redundancy <a class="header-anchor" href="#dhcp-redundancy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;DHCP Redundancy&quot;">​</a></h3><p>If the customer configured Host 1, Host 2 and Host 3, then Nile will send the request to all three servers. Whichever server responds first, IP will be used. if the other two respond, we will ignore them. So, redundancies need to be configured between the servers.</p><h4 id="option-1-vip" tabindex="-1">Option 1 - VIP <a class="header-anchor" href="#option-1-vip" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Option 1 - VIP&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Customers can configure two or more DHCP servers with a VIP. In that case they only need to configure Host 1 with the VIP and not configure Host 2 and Host 3</p><h4 id="option-2-multiple-server-with-load-balancing" tabindex="-1">Option 2 - Multiple server with load balancing <a class="header-anchor" href="#option-2-multiple-server-with-load-balancing" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Option 2 - Multiple server with load balancing&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Customers can configure all 3 hosts, but the servers are clustered together so even though all 3 will receive the DHCP request only one will respond with an offer</p><p>In short customer needs to configure redundancy on the DHCP server side</p><h3 id="nile-as-default-gateway" tabindex="-1">Nile as default gateway <a class="header-anchor" href="#nile-as-default-gateway" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Nile as default gateway&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Taking the previous example, the customer will come to the Nile portal and add the following under the subnet section as seen in the screenshot.</p><ol><li>Subnet 1 - 192.168.1.0/24, DFG -192.168.1.1</li><li>Subnet 2 - 192.168.2.0/24, DFG -192.168.2.1</li><li>Subnet 3 - 192.168.3.0/24, DFG -192.168.3.1</li></ol><p>Once the configuration of segments and SSID&#39;s is complete, Nile will identify the sites where the DHCP server belongs to and push the appropriate IP&#39;s to the Nile Service Block. These NSB will now be the default gateway for all the subnets that were pushed.</p><p>So it’s very important to ensure the default gateway and subnets configured in the DHCP server and Nile DHCP settings page match</p>',23),l=[n];function h(d,c,u,p,f,g){return a(),t("div",null,l)}const P=e(s,[["render",h]]);export{m as __pageData,P as default};
