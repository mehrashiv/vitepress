Nile Guest Service decreases the possibility of a data breach and accelerates network troubleshooting.  Nile Guest Service isolates visitor traffic from internal network resources by automatically tunneling traffic between your site and a local point of presence (PoP), from where it is forwarded directly to the internet.</p><p>To summarize, the Nile Guest Service provides complete isolation of the guest traffic from your existing network, thus securing your corporate network, and also providing zero configuration and management of the guest users.</p><p><strong>Assumptions</strong></p><p>Customer has the Nile Access Service already.</p><p>This document assumes the reader has a working knowledge of networking principles and network administration.</p><p><strong>How can Nile Guest Service benefit me?</strong></p><p>&quot;As an administrator, I want to ensure that all my guest traffic is isolated from the corporate network.&quot;</p><p>Creating a guest access solution involves many steps.  Buying and upgrading hardware.  Buying and periodically renewing licenses.  Orchestrating the setting up of each piece of equipment. Maintaining the settings to handle changing conditions.  Each piece of equipment has its own setup interface, and changes have to be coordinated among a number of components.</p><p>Get any of this complex and disjointed setup wrong, and you risk an expensive security breach.</p><p>Nile Guest Service simplifies the creation and maintenance of a secure corporate network. Administration is centralized and simplified.  Additionally, Nile Guest Service isolates guest traffic from corporate network traffic by tunneling the guest traffic to an Internet point of presence outside of the corporate network.</p><p></p><p>**                                       Guest Traffic on Corporate Network**</p><p>Reducing complexity is important because, for security reasons, the guest VLAN/Segment always needs to be isolated from the corporate traffic, so that no guest can access your internal resources.  Nile Guest Service will authenticate the guest users, as well as BYOD devices of employees.</p><p><strong>How do we know if the Nile Guest Service is up?</strong></p><p>Nile Access Service will generate an alert in the Nile Portal, on the Alert &amp; Audit page, if the Nile PoP goes down.</p><p><strong>Nile PoP:</strong></p><p>A PoP (Point of Presence) is a cloud-based server, provided by Nile, that is the bridge between guest devices on your site and the Internet.</p><p><strong>Where is the PoP located?</strong></p><p>The primary PoP will be the one closest to your branch location.</p><p><strong>Given all traffic is tunneled to a PoP and then routed, what kind of latency is expected?</strong></p><p>Nile PoPs are located close to the customer locations, so the latency is sufficiently small for doing any video calls, like Zoom^®^ or teams meetings</p><p><strong>Is the tunneled traffic encrypted?</strong></p><p>Not at this time.  We use a GENEVE tunnel (General Network Encapsulation Tunnel ) from the Nile Service Block (NSB) Gateway on your site(s) to the closest Nile PoP.</p><p><strong>What ports do I need to open on the firewall for the tunnel?</strong></p><p>Open UDP port 6081 inbound and outbound on your firewalls. The inbound pinhole is not required if your firewall software does connection tracking of GENEVE connections.</p><p><strong>How do we configure the Nile PoP?</strong></p><p>Once you sign up for the service, the Nile Portal is automatically enabled for your tenant. The DHCP server, client subnets, segment, and SSID are created by us for you. All you need to do is edit the SSID name on the wireless page and save it. Once you save it, we will start beaconing the SSID in your locations.</p><p><strong>Can a user open an unauthorized connection,  via the Nile Portal, into the corporate network?</strong></p><p>No.  Connections are initiated only by a properly authenticated guest user. Data exchange over a guest connection is via the above-mentioned tunnel, to the Nile PoP, to the service requested by the guest user, and response comes back to the Nile PoP, then back through the tunnel, and to the guest user.</p><p>Attempts by any person in the public Internet to connect to the Nile PoP will receive &quot;Port Unavailable&quot;, or other Destination Unreachable ICMP responses -- or the request packet will be completely ignored.</p><p><strong>Infrastructure:</strong></p><p><strong>How does DHCP work with Nile Guest Service?</strong></p><p>Nile Guest Service uses Nile DHCP service, which is already integrated. Nile DHCP service automatically ensures zero IP address overlap.  This eliminates the need to purchase and operate a separate DHCP service.</p><p><strong>Today we have our own HTTPS proxy to block illicit URLs. Can we use our proxy to block those illicit URLs?</strong></p><p>Depends on the service you use.  This needs to be discussed with your Nile sales associate.</p><p><strong>Does Nile offer URL filtering?</strong></p><p>Not at this time.  We will be offering this facility in the future.</p><p><strong>Can I use my own DNS server(s)?</strong></p><p>Yes, you can specify one or two publicly accessible DNS server(s). The DNS server(s) should each have a public IP address. You can change the server(s) to be used when you click on the Guest SSID.</p><p><strong>Monitoring and authenticating guest users:</strong></p><p><strong>Do I have visibility into what guest users are connect to my network?</strong></p><p>Yes, you can see the details about the guest device, on the client details page on the Nile Portal. ** **</p><p><strong>Can Nile provide visibility to all guest traffic i.e. user flow data?</strong></p><p>Yes, you can see that on Nile Portal, just like we show it for your employee traffic flow.</p><p><strong>Can I revoke an already connected Guest user?</strong></p><p>No.  This feature will be available in the future.</p><p><strong>Is it possible to view the guest user events within the Nile portal, specifically to determine whether the user has accepted the terms and conditions (TNC) and successfully obtained an IP address?</strong></p><p>Yes.</p><p><strong>Do we have control over how guest users can authenticate?  What will be the guest experience be, when connecting to Nile Guest Service?</strong></p><p>Yes, you have control.  The experience depends on how the authentication is set up for the guest SSID. When the user selects the Guest SSID on his or her device, they will be shown a page from a captive portal, where they will have the below experience depending upon the authentication setup on the Nile Portal: <strong>Click Through</strong>, where the user will be shown terms and conditions and connect to the SSID directly; or* *<strong>Sponsored Guest Login a.k.a. Email Approval</strong> , where the user will input their name and email address, and the name and email address of the sponsor; the sponsor will then get an email requesting approval; once the sponsor approves it, the user device will become authenticated on the network.</p><p><strong>Can we customize the guest portal with our own branding?</strong></p><p>Not yet.  That feature will be available in the future.</p><p><strong>Can we supply text of our terms and conditions?</strong></p><p>Yes, you can copy and paste your own terms and conditions.</p><p><strong>Can Nile rate-limit guest traffic?</strong></p><p>The traffic rate is not rate limited. Instead, Guest Service applies auto-QoS policy shaping on the Guest SSID.  That is, traffic for the non-guest SSIDs are given higher preference, and traffic for the Guest SSID is given lower preference.</p>',60),i=[r];function a(c,l,p,u,h,d){return o(),t("div",null,i)}const w=e(s,[["render",a]]);export{f as __pageData,w as default};
