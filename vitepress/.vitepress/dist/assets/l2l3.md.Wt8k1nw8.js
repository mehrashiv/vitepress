Take a 3-tier architecture for example. We have an access layer which connects to a distribution layer which in turn connects to a core routing layer. C1 All devices are assigned to a VLAN. Hence the admin needs to define these VLANs in the distribution and access layer.</p><p>C2 - If using an independent Acesss Point we need to trunk the AP’s ethernet port with all the VLANs. If it’s a wired switch then each port needs be configured with a VLAN and the uplink with a trunk. If it is a wireless controller, then the uplink port has to be trunked. Anytime a new VLAN is introduced, the admin has to configure the entire stack. This is time consuming and error prone.</p><p>C3 - Between the L3 switch and router OSPF can be leveraged to distribute the routes.</p><p>C4 – With Nile’s architecture there is no VLAN’s or trunk required within the NSB.</p><p>C5 - Instead of assigning VLAN’s to devices, segments are assigned which are essentially subnets</p><p>C6 – The admin defines all the subnets in the Nile portal which pushes these settings to the NSB. The NSB thus becomes the default gateway for all subnets</p><p>C7 – The NSB exchanges these routers with the upstream firewall or router to route packets in and out thus eliminating the needs for trunks and VLANS</p><h2 id="dpi-fingerprint-and-qos-add-headend" tabindex="-1">DPI Fingerprint and QoS add HeadEnd <a class="header-anchor" href="#dpi-fingerprint-and-qos-add-headend" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;DPI Fingerprint and QoS add HeadEnd&quot;">​</a></h2>',11),o=[s];function h(d,c,l,p,u,_){return a(),t("div",null,o)}const g=e(n,[["render",h]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
