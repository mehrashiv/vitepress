Let's dive a bit deeper into the architecture and see how does a traditional L2 network compare to Nile’s L3 architecture. 
Take a 3-tier architecture for example. We have an access layer which connects to a distribution layer which in turn connects to a core routing layer. 
C1 All devices are assigned to a VLAN. Hence the admin needs to define these VLANs in the distribution and access layer. 

C2 - If using an independent Acesss Point we need to trunk the AP’s ethernet port with all the VLANs. If it’s a wired switch then each port needs be configured with a VLAN and the uplink with a trunk. If it is a wireless controller, then the uplink port has to be trunked. Anytime a new VLAN is introduced, the admin has to configure the entire stack. This is time consuming and error prone.

C3 - Between the L3 switch and router OSPF can be leveraged to distribute the routes.

C4 – With Nile’s architecture there is no VLAN’s or trunk required within the NSB. 

C5 - Instead of assigning VLAN’s to devices, segments are assigned which are essentially subnets

C6 – The admin defines all the subnets in the Nile portal which pushes these settings to the NSB. The NSB thus becomes the default gateway for all subnets

C7 – The NSB exchanges these routers with the upstream firewall or router to route packets in and out thus eliminating the needs for trunks and VLANS
